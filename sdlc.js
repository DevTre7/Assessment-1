// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// 1-Planning
// 2-Analysis of Requirements
// 3-Design
// 4-Implementation
// 5-Testing & Integration
// 6-Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle
    and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." ;
const AnalysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step where the team needs to understand the goals of the product, requirements, objectives necessary and meet the client's need.";
const Design = "This is the phase where the development of design of the client's product start. UI/UX designers, lead archictects, and Software developers work closely togehter. This may result in design layouts or diagrams of the product's design.";
const Implementation = "This phase begins once the developer(SWE) gets the design documunet or layout fromthe design team and is able to translate it into code.";
const TestingAndIntergration = "In this phase the software that has been developed from the prievous phase is tested thoroughly for any bugs or errors. The Integration part is when are parts of the software (such as subsytems and components) are unified and compatible ";
const Maintain = "The Final stage where the software goes live and is monitored by mainintaing updates, procedures, and evaluations inorder to ensure functionality and quality.";
